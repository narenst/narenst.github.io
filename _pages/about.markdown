Hi, I'm Naren. I specialize in architecting and building ML / AI platforms in the cloud. I work with companies 
at the different stages of AI adoption and provide guidance and hands-on help with their infrastructure needs.

I have more than 8 years of experience in this area. I'm the co-founder and CTO of [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) (YCombinator 17' batch) - a cloud platform for building, training and deploying Deep Learning models. FloydHub has hundreds of businesses and thousands of Data Scientists on the platform building and deploying ML products into production.

I was the Director of Engineering at [Avast](https://www.avast.com/en-us/index) before and I have a MS in CS degress from Stanford.

This is my personal site where I write about cloud computing, AI and sometimes tech in general. I will also 
share my side projects here. You can reach me at n <at> naren.st. I love chatting about infrastructure, cloud 
and tech and helping folks with their problems. If you have something to talk abour or questions on anything, 
feel free to reach out!
