## What can I offer

I can help you in the following areas:

### Cloud Infrastructure for AI

- Setting up cloud infrastructure for Data Science teams.
- Evaluating different cloud options, open source tools and SAAS products for your requirements.

### Adoption of new tooling 

- Evaluating and implementing new tools for Data Scientists
- Running Jupyter notebook servers with secure access to data.
- Set up model training pipelines using workflow management tools.
- Deployment of models in production - including scaling and monitoring

### AI Management

- Evaluating your current cloud setup and find opportunity to reduce cost
- Guidance in overall engineering and platform strategy for your organization
- Hiring members for the platform team


## My Expertise

I have hands-on experience in building [FloydHub](https:///www.floydhub.com) from ground up. FloydHub is a a cloud platform for building, training and deploying Deep Learning models. FloydHub has hundreds of businesses and thousands of Data Scientists on the platform building and deploying ML products into production.

I have worked with companies at the different stages of AI adoption and provide guidance and hands-on help with their infrastructure needs. I also build open source projects that help infrastructure teams in managing the cloud instances used by data scientists.

I also have over 10 years of management experience. I can help with building out and scaling your AI engineering team based on your needs.

## Projects

### Infinity

_Fully managed Spot GPU machines for ML development. Infinite power at minimal cost._

This open source tool uses AWS APIs to create spot instances and sets up Jupyter Lab for the Data Scientists to start developing their model. It also provides price comparison for instances across AWS regions.

### Dockerfiles for Machine Learning

Collection of Dockerfiles useful for NLP and Deep Learning. Includes Dockerfiles for most popular frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch - optimized for both CPU and GPU instance types. These Dockerfiles have been downloaded more than 100K times.
